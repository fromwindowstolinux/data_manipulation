# Balanced Parentheses Validator

Implement a function that validates whether a given string containing parentheses is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order. The parentheses can be any of the following: (), [], or {}.

For example:

- The string "()[]{}" is balanced.

- The string "{[()]}" is balanced.

- The string "({[)]}" is not balanced.

Write a function in preferred programming language that takes a string as input and returns `True` if the parentheses are balanced, and `False` otherwise.

Constraints:

- The input string will consist of only the characters “(“, “)”, “[“, “]”, “{“, and “}”.

- The length of the input string will not exceed 10^4.

Feel free to use standard library functions or data structures available in chosen programming language.
